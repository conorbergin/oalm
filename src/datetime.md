# Dates, Times, Intervals and Durations

Normal calendar functions:
- A Date - a birthday
- From one date to another - a holiday
- A DateTime - deadline
- From one DateTime to another - a dentist appointment

Gantt charts and network diagrams:
- A Duration, maybe with a priority


If a node has a single date, it is treated as a deadline, any subnodes with durations are packed automatically, any nodes with dates are allowed to fall outside
